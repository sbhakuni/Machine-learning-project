```bash
pip install zenml["server"]
zenml up
```
If you are running the `run_deployment.py` script, you will also need to install some integrations using ZenML:

```bash
zenml integration install mlflow -y
```

The project can only be executed with a ZenML stack that has an MLflow experiment tracker and model deployer as a component. Configuring a new stack with the two components are as follows:

```bash
zenml integration install mlflow -y
zenml experiment-tracker register mlflow_tracker --flavor=mlflow
zenml model-deployer register mlflow --flavor=mlflow
zenml stack register mlflow_stack -a default -o default -d mlflow -e mlflow_tracker --se
```
